# Walkoff

##Introduction
The purpose of WALKOFF is to create a development standard for orchestration capabilities.  Most commercial orchestratiors are currently built upon an app based architecture. In other words, in order to integrate a commercial device into an orchestration platform an app must be built using the orchestrator's proprietary API.  This presents a number of different issues, foremost being the same capabilities are being written over and over again for each proprietary API.  Second, orchestrators' capablities are limited by the apps that have been built for them.  Finally, environments are being locked in to proprietary APIs because in order to switch new integration pieces will have to be leveraged using another API for identical capabilities.  

WALKOFF seeks to alleviate these pains by creating a standard development framework so that capablities only need to be written once and can then be deployed across compatible orchestrators.  The WALKOFF orchestrator that has been written here is an implementation of the WALKOFF standard.  Its primary purpose is to serve as a vehicle for community engagement and adoption as well as serve as a testbed for the continued evolution of the WALKOFF framework.
