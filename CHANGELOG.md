## [0.6.0]
###### 2018-01-02

Introducing roles, messages, and notifications

### Added
* Administrators can now create custom roles and assign users to those roles.
  Each resource of the server endpoint is protected by a permission, and roles
  can be created which combine resource permissions.
* Messages and notifications
  * Actions can now send messages to users
  * Messages can be used to convey information to users or to pause a workflow
    and wait for a user to approve its continued execution
  * When a user receives a message, a notification will appear
* Easy updates
  * An update script is provided to update to the most recent version if one is
    available. This script includes custom workflow migration scripts and
    database migration scripts generated by SqlAlchemy-Alembic. These are a work in progress.
      * _Note: Database migrations only work for default database locations and
    using SQLite. This can be changed in the `alembic.ini` file_
  * This script also includes utility functions for backing up the WALKOFF directory, cleaning pycache, setting up WALKOFF after an update, etc.
* Explicit failure return codes for actions
  * Return codes which indicate a failure of the action can be marked with
    `failure: true`. This will cause an ActionExecutionError event to be sent
* Explicit success default return codes for actions
  * The default return code for an action can be specified with
    `default_return: YourReturnHere`
* Internal ZeroMQ addresses can be configured through the UI

### Changed
* Significant repository restructure
  * This repository restructure combined the `core` and `server` packages into
    a single `walkoff` package and moved modules such as `appcache` and
    `devicedb` out of the `apps` package
  * Top-level scripts with the exception of `walkoff.py` are now located in the
    `scripts` directory
  * These changes make the Walkoff project follow a more canonical repository
    structure, and are one step towards being able to install walkoff using
    `pip`, our eventual goal.
* Classes have been moved out of the `server.context.Context` class. They were
  located there to remove circular dependencies, but they have been moved into
  their own submodule.
* The `interface.__init__` module has been split into multiple modules
* The Sphinx Python documentation has been relocated to the `docs` directory
  and can be generated using `make html`. Additionally, they now use the
  ReadTheDocs theme.
* Google Protocol Buffer message structure has been significantly altered.

### Security
* JWT structure changes
  * JWTs' identity is now the user ID, not the username
  * JWT claims are now the username and a list of role IDs this user
    possesses. These claims are populated on login, and require
    reauthentication to be updated.

## [0.5.0]
###### 2017-11-29

Introducing a more user-friendly playbook editor and custom event-driven
interfaces

### Added
* New user-friendly playbook editor
* Host and port can now be specified on the command line
* App-specific conditions and transforms
  * Conditions and transforms are now located in apps rather than in core, so
    they can be more easily created
* Branches now contain a "priority" field which can be used to determine the
  order in which the branches of a given action are evaluated
* Arguments to actions, conditions, and transforms which use references can
  select which component of the referenced action's output to use.
* Migration scripts to help ease a variety of backward-breaking changes --
  `migrate_workflows.py` and `migrate_api.py`
* Scripts to create Sphinx documentation have been added to the repository


### Changed
* Custom interfaces with event handling
  * Interfaces are no longer attached to apps; they are now their own plugins
    and are contained in the `interfaces` directory
  * Interfaces can use new decorator functions to listen and respond to all
    events in Walkoff as they occur
* Better triggers
  * Triggers are no longer specified in the database. Instead, each individual
    action in a workflow can have its own set of conditions which can act as
    breakpoints in a workflow. You can send data to them through the server and
    have that data validated against a set of conditions before the action can
    resume.
  * You can still start a workflow from the beginning through the server
* Renamed workflow components for clarity
  * "steps" have been renamed "actions"
  * "next steps" have been renamed "branches"
  * "flags" have been renamed "conditions"
  * "filters" have been renamed "transforms"
* Script used to start the server has been renamed `walkoff.py`
* ZeroMQ keys are contained in the `.certificates` directory
* Playbook file format changes
  * Branches are now contained outside of actions, creating two top-level
    fields.
  * Branches have a `source_uid` and a `destination_uid` instead of just a
    `name` field
  * The `start` step on a workflow is indicated with the start step's UID
    instead of its name
  * The `app` and `action` fields of actions, conditions, and transforms have
    been renamed `app_name` and `action_name` respectively.
  * Conditions and transforms contain an `app_name` field instead of just an
    `action` field
  * We have removed the `widgets` field and the `risk` field from actions
  * Devices for actions are specified by id rather than by name
  * Actions' `inputs` field, as well as conditions' and transforms' `args`
    field has been renamed `arguments` and is now a complete JSON object
  * Playbooks now contain a `walkoff_version` field which will be used to
    indicate which version of WALKOFF created them. This will be helpful in the
    future to migrate workflows to new formats
* Minor changes to api.yaml schema
  * `dataIn` has been renamed `data_in`
  * `termsOfService` has been renamed `terms_of_service`
  * `externalDocs` has been renamed `external_docs` and is always an array
* Performance of worker processes has been improved by removing gevent from
  child processes and reducing polling
* The blinker Signals used to trigger events have been wrapped in a
  WalkoffEvent enum
* Internal sockets used for ZeroMQ communication have been moved to
  `core.config.config`
* Actions which are defined inside of a class must supply a device, or the
  workflow will fail on initialization
* The REST API to get the APIs of apps has been enhanced significantly and
  returns all of the API


### Removed
* Unfortunately, event-driven actions have been broken for some time now. We
  have removed this functionality, but are working on an even better
  replacement for them in the meantime
* We have removed accumulated risk from workflows and risk from steps. This
  feature will be re-added at a future date
* We have removed widgets from the backend. This feature will be reimplemented
  later.
* Backend support for adding roles to users has been removed. All users are
  administrators as they have been in previous releases. There was never a UI
  component for this feature, and it was breaking some other components for
  editing users. Roles will be re-added in the next release.

### Security
* HTTPS is enabled by default if certificates are placed in the
  `.certificates` directory.

### Contributor
* Coverage.py is used to generate test coverage report. Travis-CI will fail if
  the code coverage is below 81% This percentage will rise over time
