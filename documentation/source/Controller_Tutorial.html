      <h1>Controller Tutorial</h1>
         <h5 class="w3-padding-32">On the left sidebar, you will find a number of different tabs. Towards the top is the "Controller" tab, which brings you to the Controller Management 
          page. On this page you will find three panels: the "Playbook Management" panel, the "Cases" panel, and the "Scheduler" panel.</a></h5>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The "Playbook Management" page gives you the ability to load various workflows into a playbook. A "playbook" is a series of workflows that are grouped
            together. You can expand the various workflows in the playbook using the arrows on the left side of the filename. In addition, you can load a playbook by clicking on the "Load
            Playbook" towards the bottom of the "Playbook Management" panel, and selecting an XML file to load. At the bottom of the panel, you will see the status of the execution of
            each workflow in the playbook. </a></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The next panel is the "Cases" panel. A case is a collection of execution events you wish to log together, which we call the case's event 
              subscriptions. As a workflow or collection of workflows is executed, the events to which the case is subscribed to are logged. Each level of execution contains multiple
              events which can be subscribed to. For more detail on cases, please view the "Case Overview" tutorial. In this panel, you will see the cases that have been loaded 
              (i.e. cases to which you are subscribed), and then below that you have the ability to add a case via the "Add Case" button.</a></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The final panel is the "Scheduler" panel. The scheduler is what actually schedules and executes the various workflows that have been loaded in
              the playbook. This panel gives you the ability to control the scheduler, i.e. the ability to control the execution of the workflows. There are 4 buttons to control this:
              Start, Pause, Resume, and Stop. The current state of the scheduler is also listed so that you know what the scheduler is doing. The scheduler must be in the "Started" 
              state to execute workflows, and you can also pause and resume the scheduler to pause/resume execution. Finally, you may completely stop execution by clicking the "Stop"
              button. </a></h5>
