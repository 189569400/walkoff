                Conditions are Boolean conditions which much be met before an action progresses to another. The
                conditions are implemented in apps. Each condition takes zero or more
                arguments and an input. When executing a workflow, the input to a condition is the output from the previous
                action. Additionally, data can be filtered or otherwise transformed through a
                <a href="Transform_Overview.html">Transform</a> before being evaluated. Each condition can have its own list of
                transforms, the output of the first being used as the input to the second and so on.
