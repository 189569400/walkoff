            <h1> Messages, Notifications, and Human in the Loop execution </h1>
            <p> Say you have a workflow on a schedule that periodically scans for suspicious user activity on your
                network. You would certainly want to be alerted when it finds a suspicious user. You could set up a case
                which logs actions taken in this workflow and monitor the generated event log, or you could have your
                workflow send you an email or an SMS if it finds a suspicious user. But Walkoff also supports in-app
                messaging from your workflow to your Walkoff inbox. You simply add an action in your workflow, select
                which users or user roles the message should be sent to, and that action will send a message to those
                users' inbox.
            </p>
            <!-- HERE GOES IMAGE OF MESSAGE WITH NO ACCEPT DECLINE -->
            <p> If the user is on the app while that workflow runs, they will receive a notification
                popup. To support this, Walkoff supports text and URL links in the messages.
            </p>
            <!-- HERE GOES IMAGE OF MESSAGE -->
            <p> You can combine messages with triggers to provide human-in-the-loop execution. If our workflow
                identifies a suspicious user, the next action taken might be to kick them off the network, but maybe you
                want a human to make that final decision instead of your workflow. Once a malicious user is found, you
                can send a message with an "Accept/Decline" component, and the message will have buttons labeled
                "Accept" and "Decline". The next step of your workflow would be a trigger attached to the
                "accept/decline" action, and the workflow will then wait for one of the users who received the message
                to select "accept" or "decline". Your workflow can then react to the user's selection.
