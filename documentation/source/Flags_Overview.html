            <p>
                Flags are conditions which much be met before a step progresses to another. The condition which must be
                met is selected from a list functions defined in the core/flags directory. Each flag takes zero or more
                arguments and an input. When executing a workflow, the input to a flag is the output from the previous
                step. Additionally, data can be filtered or otherwise transformed through a
                <a href="Filter_Overview.html">Filter</a> before being evaluated. Each flag can have its own list of
                filters, the output of the first being used as the input to the second and so on.
