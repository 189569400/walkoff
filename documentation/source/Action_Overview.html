            <p>
                Actions are the fundamental units of execution in a Workflow. Each app has a set of defined actions,
                all of which can be made used in a Workflow. If some error occurs during the execution of the Action,
                a step will return error codes which can be used with Branches to handle the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                To execute an Action, the Workflow must provide any required inputs the app's Action. On the successful
                conclusion of the Action's execution, it selects the next Action to take using
                <a href="Branch_Overview.html">Branches</a> in the Workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Actions can also have "triggers". Using triggers, you can have an action pause until the correct data is
                provided to a URL on the WALKOFF server. You can define what is "correct" data for your action using
                a  <a href="ConditionalExpression_Overview.html">Conditional Expression</a> which is evaluated against
                the data sent to the URL.
