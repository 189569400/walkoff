            <p>
                A Branch object is a linkage between two <a href="Action_Overview.html">Actions</a>, a source and a
                destination Action with a list of <a href="Condition_Overview.html">Conditions</a> which must all
                evaluate to be true for an Action to progress from the source Action to the destination Action. If no
                conditions are provided, then the destination Action named will act as a default or catch-all Action,
                and the source Action will always progress to the destination Action. Multiple branches can share the
                same source Action. In this case, those branches have a configurable priority in which they and their
                associated Conditions will be evaluated. The first Branch whose conditions evaluate as True will
                determine the next Action taken by the Workflow. An Action can also result in a variety of status codes.
                These can be custom-created and defined by the action, but the default statuses are "Success",
                "UnhandledException", and "InvalidArguments". These status codes can be used with branches to control
                execution flow.
