            <h1>Manual Execution - The Dashboard</h1>
            <h6>You can manually run a workflow through the Playbook Editor of the dashboard. When you execute a
                workflow through the Playbook Editor, you'll see the workflow execute in real time along with the
                results of each step. This option is particularly good for debugging and rapidly developing your
                workflows. Learn more about the Playbook Editor

            <h1>Active Execution - The Scheduler</h1>
            <h6>You can schedule a workflow or a set of workflows to execute on a timer. This could be as simple as
                running them once at a particular date and time, or scheduling them to run every 10 seconds between two
                dates, or at 10:30am every 3rd Wednesday of every other month. The option is good for running periodic
                scans or tasks. Learn more about the scheduler

            <h1>Passive Execution - The Triggers</h1>
            <h6>You can also configure the system to execute a workflow in response to an event in one of two ways --
                by directly executing an entire workflow or by resuming a paused workflow. To execute a workflow
                directly, you can use a URL defined in our REST API which requires only that you know the playbook name
                and the workflow name. The response from server contains a UID of that executing workflow. When executed
                directly from WALKOFF's REST API, an additional field can be sent which can change the arguments to
                the first step of the workflow. Inside of your workflow, each step can have triggers, which are a list of
                <a href="Condition_Overview.html">Conditions</a>. If a step has a trigger, then when the workflow
                reaches that step it waits until the correct data is sent to it. The correct data is whatever data is
                validated against the Conditions. If no Conditions are specified, then no data is required to be sent.
                To send data to a workflow which is awaiting trigger data, you can use a different endpoint and the UID
                given when the workflow was called on to be executed. To get a status of all executing workflows,
                including their execution UIDs, you can use the WorkflowResults server endpoints from our REST API.
