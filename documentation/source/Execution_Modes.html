            <h1>Manual Execution - The Dashboard</h1>
            <h6>You can manually run a workflow through the Playbook Editor of the dashboard. When you execute a
                workflow through the Playbook Editor, you'll see the workflow execute in real time along with the
                results of each step. This option is particularly good for debugging and rapidly developing your
                workflows. Learn more about the Playbook Editor

            <h1>Active Execution - The Scheduler</h1>
            <h6>You can schedule a workflow or a set of workflows to execute on a timer. This could be as simple as
                running them once at a particular date and time, or scheduling them to run every 10 seconds between two
                dates, or at 10:30am every 3rd Wednesday of every other month. The option is good for running periodic
                scans or tasks. Learn more about the scheduler

            <h1>Passive Execution - The Triggers</h1>
            <h6>You can also configure the system to execute a workflow in response to an event using a trigger.
                A trigger is a workflow connected to a set of conditions which allows you to execute a workflow via
                the REST API. Through this REST API, you can send data which can be validated against a series of Flags.
                If the the flags all return True, then the workflow associated with the trigger is executed.
                On the Triggers page accessible from the dashboard, you have the ability to view,
                edit, and add a Trigger. Learn more about trigger management
