            <h1>Conditional Expressions</h1>
            <p>
                Conditional Expressions are compound statements which encapsulate Boolean (true/false) logic. They are
                used to control the flow execution between actions and as a trigger on an action. An example
                would be the statement "If A, B, and not C happen, or if D, E, or F happen, then ...". Conditional
                Expressions have four components - a list of <a href="Condition_Overview.html">Conditions</a> which can
                be empty, a list of child Conditional Expressions which can also be empty, an operator which determines
                how to combine the conditions and child expressions, and a Boolean value indicating if the the result
                should be negated (if the Conditional Expression would return true, then return false, and vice versa).
                In our example above, That statement would be a conditional expression with two child expressions
                (themselves Conditional Expressions) joined by the "or" operator. The first child expression would the
                "and" operator and three conditions -- A, B, and C. The C condition would have its "is_negated" field
                set to "true." The second child expression would have the "or" operator and three conditions -- D, E,
                and F.
