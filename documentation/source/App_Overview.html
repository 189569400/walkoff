            <h1>App Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The app framework allows WALKOFF to easily integrate with other software. If it has an API, it can be
                integrated into WALKOFF. The team at WALKOFF have strived to make writing apps as
                quick and pain-free as possible. Developing is as simple as writing a Python module in the apps
                directory. There are 4 requirements for the app:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A python module called main.py which contains a class called Main which extends a common base class</li>
                <li>A YAML metadata file named api.yaml to describe the actions you create</li>
                <li>A display.py file which can be as short as 3 lines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The rest of the module is up to you. From this basis, you can incorporate custom interfaces,
                streaming data, and widget displays.
            </p>
