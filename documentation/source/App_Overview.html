            <h1>App Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The app framework allows WALKOFF to easily integrate with other software. If it has an API, it can be
                integrated into WALKOFF. The team at WALKOFF have strived to make writing apps as
                quick and painless as possible. Developing an app is as simple as writing a Python module in the apps
                directory. Any functions you write in Python can be converted into an action just by adding a decorator
                and a lightweight entry into a YAML file located inside the app. You can make a class which persists
                state and is connected to a device, and evn make your own custom interface on the webapp. It's all up to
                you.
            </p>
            <p>The WALKOFF repository comes with four apps -- a HelloWorld app which demonstrates basic capabilities, a
                SkeletonApp which can be copy and pasted to quickly start building your own app, a Utilities app
                which provides generic capabilities, and a Walkoff app which allows one instance of WALKOFF to interact
                with another instance of WALKOFF. Other apps can be found in the
                <a href="http://www.github.com/nsacyber/walkoff-apps">WALKOFF-Apps</a> repository</p>
