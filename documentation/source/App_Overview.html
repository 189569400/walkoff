            <h1>App Overview</h1>
            <p>
                The app framework allows WALKOFF to easily integrate with other software. If it has an API, it can be
                integrated into WALKOFF. The team at WALKOFF have strived to make writing apps as
                quick and painless as possible. Developing an app is as simple as writing a Python module in the apps
                directory. There are 2 requirements for the app:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A python module called main.py which contains a class called Main which extends a common base class</li>
                <li>A YAML metadata file named api.yaml to describe the actions you create</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The rest of the module is up to you. You can even incorporate custom interfaces, turning your app into
                its own website.
            </p>
            <p>The WALKOFF repository comes with three apps -- a HelloWorld app which demonstrates basic capabilities, a
                SkeletonApp which can be copy and pasted to quickly start building your own app, and a Utilities app
                which provides generic capabilities. Other apps can be found in the
                <a href="http://www.github.com/iadgov/walkoff-apps">WALKOFF-Apps</a> repository</p>
