            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <p>
                Steps are the fundamental units of execution. They encompass a specific action which is taken as well as
                containing the information about what should happen, if anything, one that step is completed. Each app
                has a set of defined actions, all of which can be made into a step. If some error occurs during the
                execution of the action, a step can contain a list of steps to to recover or otherwise handle the error.
            </p>
            <p>
                To execute a step, the workflow must provide any required inputs the app's action. On the successful
                conclusion of the step's execution, it selects the next step to take, by determining the first
                <a href="Next_Step_Overview.html">Next Step</a> element in which all of the Next Step's conditionals
                evaluate to be true. If no suitable Next Steps are found, then no further action is taken.
