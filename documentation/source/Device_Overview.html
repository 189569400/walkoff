      <h1>Devices Overview</h1>
            <p>Each app can be configured with zero or many configurations, called devices. Some apps, like a Linux
                Shell app may not need a device at all. However, an app which integrates with a particular server might
                have several devices, each of which corresponding to a different server. You can configure which fields
                are needed by your device and whether or not those fields should be stored encrypted in the database.
