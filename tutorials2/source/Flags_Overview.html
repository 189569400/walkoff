            <h1>Flags</h1>
            <p>
                Flags are conditions which much be met before a step progresses to another. The condition which must be
                met is selected from a list functions defined in the core/flags directory. Each flag takes zero or more
                arguments and an input. When executing a workflow, the input to a flag is the output from the previous
                step. Additionally, data can be filtered through a <a href="Filter_Overview.html">Filter</a> before
                being evaluated. Each flag can have its own list of filters, the output of the first being used as the
                input to the second and so on. The flags currently implemented are the following:
            </p>
            <h5>Count</a></h5>
            <p>Compares the number of elements in a collection or an integer to a value</p>
            <h6>Arguments</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Threshold - The value to compare the input to</li>
                <li>Operator - The method of comparison (<, <=, =, >=, or >)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5></a>Regular Expression Match</h5>
            <p>Attempts to compare the input to a regular expression</p>
            <h6>Arguments</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular expression - The regular expression used to match the input against</li>
            </ul>
