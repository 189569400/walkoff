      <h1>Devices Overview</h1>
            <p>Each app can be configured to zero or many devices. Some apps, like a Linux Shell app may not need a
                device at all. However, an app which integrates with a particular server might have several devices,
                each of which corresponding to a different server. Along with standard device configuration fields --
                device name, app name, username, password, IP address, and port, a user can specify any number of
                additional fields which may be required by the app. Learn how to manage devices
