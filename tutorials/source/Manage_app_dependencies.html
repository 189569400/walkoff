      <h1>Managing app dependencies</h1>
        <p>WALKOFF allows you to reduce the number of dependencies needed by allowing you to selectively install apps.</p>
        <h3>Specifying app dependencies</h3>
        <p>WALKOFF in and of itself already requires several dependencies to run. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the
            root directory of the repository. However, you may develop an app which needs additional dependencies.
            For example, if you were developing an app which incorporated machine learning, your app my depend on the popular
        <code>scikit-learn</code> Python package. However, this package has several other dependencies, and if a user
            didn't need your app, we can spare them from installing all of these dependencies by including the app-specific requirements in your app's
        <code>requirements.txt</code> file. For our example, our requirements.txt would look like this:</p>
        <pre><code class="python">
scikit-learn >= 0.18.2
        </code></pre>
        <p>The <code> >=0.18.2</code> specifies that the app requires scikit-learn with the version at least at 0.18.2</p>
        <h3>Installing app dependencies</h3>
        <p>To install an app dependency, you can use the <code>installDependencies.py</code> script included at the top
            level of the repository.</p>
        <pre><code class="console">
python installDependencies.py --apps App1
        </code></pre>
        <p>You can see more options using </p>
        <pre><code class="console">
python installDependencies.py --help
        </code></pre>
        <p>To install the dependencies for all apps in the apps folder, simply run</p>
        <pre><code class="console">python installDependencies.py</code></pre>
        <p>Next, you'll learn how to make a custom interface for your app (right now the server will quietly complain if you try to display your app)</p>
