      <h1>Settings Tutorial</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Towards the bottom of the tabs on the left-hand side is the "Settings" tab. This has two tabs, "System Settings" where you can edit various path settings,
         and "User Settings" where you can edit various user preferences and account information.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The "System Setings" tab has 3 panels: "Path Configuration", "Authorization Configuration", and "Interface Configuration". The fields that you can edit 
         are as follows. The "workflows path" is the folder containing the workflows and playbooks, the "apps path" is the folder where the apps are stored, the "templates path" is the 
         folder where the workflow templates are stored, the "profile visualizations tab" is where the visualizations are stored, the "keywords path" is where the keywords are stored,
         and the "database path" is where the main WALKOFF database is stored.</a></h5> 
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The "Authorization Configuration" panel allows you to edit various TLS settings, as follows. Which version of TLS you'd like to use, the path to the 
         certificate (public key), whether or not to enable HTTPS, and the path to the private key.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Lastly, we have the "Interface Configuration" panel, which allows you to edit some server settings. You can set the server to be in debug mode, set it to
         be the default server, and you can edit the host IP and port information.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Once you have finished editing the various settings, click "Submit" at the bottom of the page to commit your updates.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Moving over to the "User Settings" tab, we have some options related to users and roles. Each user is assigned one or more role, which defines the access
         level for that user. For example, a user with role "admin" most likely has the ability to edit any setting, but a user with role "default" might not be able to edit system 
         configuration settings.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">On the left-most panel ("User Configuration"), you can select a username from the "username" drop down, and you can change the selected user's password,
         email, whether or not the user is active in the system, and the roles of that user. You may also delete the user but clicking on "delete user" with the selected username.</a></h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Lastly, you have the ability to add a new user via the middle panel, "Add User". Simply enter in all of the user's information (email, password, role,
          etc.), and click submit.</a></h5>
