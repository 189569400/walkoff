      <h1>Devices Management</h1>
          <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
              <li>Each device has a few fields that are there by default. These fields are: device name, corresponding app, username, password, IP, and port. On top of these default fields, the user has the ability to dynamically add or change any additional fields.</li>
              <li>The user can dynamically add these fields similar to how he would pass in the default fields, but with some minor differences.</li>
              <li>The user needs to create a dictionary of extra fields, and when issuing a POST request to the add or edit device API call, the user should insert the extra fields as the string representation of the dictionary. Below is an example:</li>
              <h5 class="w3-padding-32">extraFields = {"extraKeyOne" : "extraValueOne", "extraKeyTwo" : "extraValueTwo"}</a></h5>
              <h5 class="w3-padding-32">data = {"name" : "testDeviceName",
                "extraFields" : json.dumps(extraFields)}</a></h5>
              <li>As you can see from above, the user must pass in the string representation extraFields dictionary via json.dumps().</li>
              <li>In the back-end, these extra fields are stored as the string representation of the JSON dictionary. Once there is a call to edit any of these fields, or display a device, then that string representation is loaded as a JSON dictionary via json.loads(), edited or displayed as if the extra fields were there from the beginning, and then the JSON dictionary is stored again as a string via json.dumps().</li>
          </ul>
