      <h1>Advanced Workflow Creation Tutorial</h1>
        <p>In this tutorial, we will create a more extensive Workflow with multiple branching paths that is a little more analogous to something that might be used in production.</p>

                  <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Create a new Workflow</b></h4>
                  <p>First, begin by creating a new Workflow. Enter the Playbook name and workflow name, then click Create New Workflow.</p>

                <div class="media-body">
                  <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Add actions to the workspace</b></h4>
                  <p>In this workflow, we will use actions from the included Utilities app and the FileUtilities app which can be found <a href="https://github.com/iadgov/WALKOFF-Apps">in the Apps repository</a>. The outline of the workflow is as follows:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>Take information from an action. In this example, it will be a random number from the System PRNG action, but it could be retrieving logs, messages, or other information.</li>
                    <li>If the number is under 0.5, we will proceed with storing it to a file, otherwise it will only be logged in console.</li>
                    <li>Normalize the data by rounding it to 3 decimal points.</li>
                    <li>Check if the file "test.txt" exists</li>
                    <li>Then if it does, output the metadata of the file and make it writable before appending the information to it. If it doesn't exist, we will first create the file before writing to it.</li>
                    <li>Then, the file will be marked as read-only and output the metadata again.</li> 
                  </ol>
                  <p>Drag the appropriate actions to the workspace, connect them as shown, and ensure that the System PRNG action is the starting node.</p>

                  <ol type="1">
                    <li><b>System PRNG:</b> Set the Next Node flag for "repeatBackToMe" as "count" with inputs "ge" and "0.5", and the flag for "Round to N" as "count" with inputs "l" and "0.5".</li>
                    <li><b>repeatBackToMe:</b> Set the string as "greater than or equal to 0.5".</li>
                    <li><b>Round to N:</b> Set the number to round as "@Name" (where Name is the Name of the "System PRNG" action), and the places to "3". The "@Name" syntax is used to pass outputs from other actions as inputs.</li>
                    <li><b>Exists in Directory:</b> Set the Next Node flag for "create file" as "NotExists" and the flag for "stats" as "Exists."</li>
                    <li><b>Stats:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>
                    <li><b>Create File:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt", the contents as "new file", and overwrite to "false".</li>
                    <li><b>Make Writable:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>
                    <li><b>Append File:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt", the contents as "@Name" (where Name is the Name of the "Round to N" action), and newline as "True".</li> 
                    <li><b>Make Read Only:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>
                    <li><b>Stats:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>

                  <p>Once you have all nodes configured as above, save and execute the workflow.</p>
