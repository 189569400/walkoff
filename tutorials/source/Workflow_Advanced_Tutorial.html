      <h1>Advanced Workflow Creation Tutorial</h1>
        <p>In this tutorial, we will create a more extensive Workflow with multiple branching paths that is a little
            more analogous to something that might be used in production.</p>

                    <p>In the top navigation bar, click "Playbook" to return to the playbook editor. Then, in the
                        toolbar, click the "New Workflow" button. You can specify an existing Playbook or create a
                        new one. Enter or select the Playbook name and enter the Workflow name, then click "Create
                        New Workflow."</p>

                <div class="media-body">
                  <h4 class="media-heading"><b>Add actions to the workspace</b></h4>
                  <p>In this workflow, we will use actions from the included Utilities app and the FileUtilities app
                      which can be found <a href="https://github.com/nsacyber/WALKOFF-Apps">in the Apps repository</a>.
                      The outline of the workflow is as follows:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                    <li>Take information from an action. In this example, it will be a random number from the
                        "System PRNG" action, but it could be retrieving logs, messages,
                        or other information.</li>
                    <li>If the number is greater than or equal to 0.5, we will proceed with storing it to a file, otherwise it will only
                        be logged in console.</li>
                    <li>Normalize the data by rounding it to 2 decimal points.</li>
                    <li>Check if the file "test.txt" exists</li>
                    <li>If it does, output the metadata of the file and make it writable before appending the
                        information to it. If it doesn't exist, we will first create the file before writing to it.</li>
                    <li>Then, the file will be marked as read-only and output the metadata again.</li> 
                  </ol>
                  <p>Drag the appropriate actions to the workspace, connect them as shown, and ensure that the "System
                      PRNG" action is the starting node.</p>

                    <li><b>System PRNG:</b> Set the left branch condition with the "Utilities" app's "Number Compare" with inputs "l"
                        and "0.5". Set the right branch condition with the same, but with inputs "ge" and "0.5" instead.</li>
                    <li><b>repeatBackToMe:</b> Set the string as "not noteworthy".</li>
                    <li><b>Round to N:</b> Set the number to round as the output from System PRNG using the dropdown menu, and set the number of places to "2".</li>
                    <li><b>Exists in Directory:</b> Set the filename as "test.txt." Set the left branch with the return code "NotExists" and right branch with the return code "Exists."</li>
                    <li><b>Stats:</b> Set the filename as "test.txt"</li>
                    <li><b>Create File:</b> Set the filename as "test.txt", the contents as "This is the beginning of the file", and overwrite
                        to "false". Set the only branch with the return code "FileCreated."</li>
                    <li><b>Make Writable:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>
                    <li><b>Append File:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt", the contents as the output from Round to N, and newline as "True". Set the only branch with the return code "FileWritten."</li>
                    <li><b>Make Read Only:</b> Set the file name as "test.txt"</li>
