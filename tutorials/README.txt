This folder contains the files for generating the tutorial
pages. Please do not edit any HTML files inside the build folder (but
please do edit any image files inside the build/images folder).

Instead, edit the HTML files inside the source folder. Then run:

./build-tutorial.py

from within this folder. This will generate the HTML files inside the
build folder by prepending and appending each of the files in the
source folder with header.html and footer.html, respectively. Commit
and push all files inside both the source and build folders to github.
